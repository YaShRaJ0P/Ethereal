  <h1 class="title">Some Simple Ideas To Begin Sustainable Living</h1>

  <p class="content">If the end of the world would depend on you, would you save it? This is a tough question, yet we hold this responsibility
    every second of every day. We live in a world that needs our help to keep surviving, but are we doing enough?
  <br/><br/>
  Here I will share with you some of the best ways in how to live sustainability and adopt a more
  sustainable lifestyle that will make a difference in the world that we all share.
  </p>
  
  <h1 class="title">What Living A Sustainable Lifestyle Means</h1>
  <p class="content">
Living a sustainable lifestyle is adopting a new way of living. It's to live in a way that would meet all the natural human needs to be
alive, which are basically food, water, and shelter. But without any extra luxury and resources that bring no value for our surviving
and can potentially harm the planet.
<br/> <br/>    <img src="images/issuensol.jpg" alt="" class=" floatright">
The main reason to adopt a sustainable lifestyle and deprive ourselves of things that we don't need is mainly to attempt to
reduce the negative impact that we continually have on this planet.
<br/><br/>
That way, we stand a chance to ensure that future generations will have not only a place to call home but will have the essential
resources that they need to survive.
<br/><br/>

So if you think about it, choosing to live a more sustainable life is just like an excellent investment for future generations to come.
to give them a chance to live in this world and experience the amazing things that our planet can offer.
<br/><br/>
By reducing our carbon footprint, our energy consumptions, fashion choices, and our diets, we can make a difference that will
change the lives of future generations to come. 
<br/><br/>
We are all here due to the man heroic actions that generations before us took upon them to ensure that we could have a
future, so isn't it our obligation to ensure that the next ones will have a standing chance as well?
  </p>

  <h1 class="title">The Importance of Sustainable Living</h1>
  <p class="content">
    The answer is quite simple andstraightforward we need our planet to keep being able to resource us with the basic things
    that we need to survive. It's about survival but it's also about stopping catastrophic disasters from happening.
    <br/><br/>
    Natural disasters are not just accidental damage from mother nature. We are the cause for many of the climate change
    challenges that we have been experiencing, things like floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, even the abnormal snowing in the Sahara desert.
    <br/><br/>
    Our impact has consequences on the planet, and many of those will affect us directly. Mainly due to
    the things that we use every day.
    <br/><br/>
    Things like the enormous and misplaced amount of garbage disposal, the high demand for fossil fuel (that provide us with
electricity). Excessive carbon print and wrongly disposal of toxic chemicals into the sea, are just some of the human-made acts
against the environment. Little but incredible impactful actions can lead to : <br/> <br/>
<img src="images/recycle.jpg" alt="" class="floatright">
â€¢ Health problems, which have been more and more common. <br/>
â€¢ Climate change, for example, the rising levels of the water. <br/>
â€¢ Lack of resources from mother nature, without water and food, we can't survive. <br/><br/>
Little and almost seamless acts such as dropping a little straw on the ground can have terrible consequences that will affect
every person, animal, and the environment. So if you could make a difference today, would you?
<br/><br/>
  There are so many little actions that will have a tremendous impact on saving the world and you can do them so easily and
  without much effort Small action that will help you to be more grateful for the world that we all share.
  Living a sustainable lifestyle might seem simple, but it represents a tremendous feeling of joy in
  knowing that you are one of the reasons why future generations will have a chance.

        <h5 class="w3-padding-32 padding">A Seabin is an innovative technology designed to address ocean pollution by collecting plastic and other debris from the water's surface. <br>

          Here are some features of Seabin: <br>
          A Seabin is a floating device that can be installed in marinas, ports, and other areas with calm water. <br>
          The device works by using a submersible water pump to create a flow of water, which pulls floating debris into a collection bag inside the Seabin. <br>

The collected debris can be easily removed from the Seabin, and the water is filtered before being returned to the ocean. <br>

Seabins are designed to capture a variety of debris, including microplastics, cigarette butts, and oil. <br>

The technology was invented by two Australian surfers, Andrew Turton and Pete Ceglinski, who were frustrated by the amount of plastic they encountered in the ocean while surfing. <br>

Seabins are a sustainable solution to ocean pollution, as they require minimal energy to operate and can be made from recycled materials. <br>

The installation of Seabins can also provide educational opportunities for the community to learn about the impact of plastic pollution on the environment. <br>

Seabins are not a complete solution to ocean pollution, as they only address surface-level debris. To fully address the problem, a combination of solutions, such as reducing plastic consumption and improving waste management, is needed. <br>

        <h5 class="w3-padding-32 padding">Created by Aqualonis,CloudFisher could allow people living in coastal or mountainous areas to convert fog into safe drinking water. This water can also be used to irrigate crops or for forestry efforts.  <br>

          Cloud fishing, also known as fog harvesting, is a method of collecting water from fog. It involves using large mesh nets that are placed in the path of fog to capture the moisture. This technique has been used for many years in arid and semi-arid regions where traditional sources of water are scarce. <br>
          
          Cloud fishing has recently gained attention as a sustainable solution for communities facing water scarcity. One such example is the cloud fisher project that converts fog into drinking water. The project is in Morocco and is run by the German NGO, Dar Si Hmad. <br>
          
          The cloud fisher project uses specially designed mesh nets made from high-density polyethylene. These nets are installed on mountainous terrain where the winds carry the fog. The fog droplets that are captured by the nets are then collected in gutters and directed into storage tanks. <br>
          
          The water collected from the fog is then treated to remove any impurities before it is distributed to the local communities. The cloud fisher project has been successful in providing clean drinking water to over 400 people in the Ait Baamrane region of Morocco. <br>
          
          Cloud fishing has many benefits over traditional water collection methods. It is a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution that does not require the use of energy or chemicals. Additionally, it provides a reliable source of water in areas where there is little rainfall orâ€¯surfaceâ€¯water. <br>

        <h5 class="w3-padding-32 padding">The Groasis Waterboxx is a device that helps to plant trees in arid and semi-arid areas, by providing them with the necessary water and nutrients to grow. The Waterboxx was invented by Dutch entrepreneur Pieter Hoff in 2003 and has since been used in over 50 countries around the world. <br>

          The Waterboxx is a round plastic container that is placed around the base of a tree sapling. The container is filled with water and nutrients, and then covered with a lid that allows water to slowly drip out, providing the tree with a steady supply of water over a period of several months. The Waterboxx also protects the tree from harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme heat and wind. <br>
          
          The Waterboxx is designed to be a low-cost, sustainable solution for planting trees in dry areas. It requires no external energy source or maintenance and can be easily transported and installed by a single person. The Waterboxx has been shown to increase the survival rate of tree saplings from less than 10% to over 90% and can help to restore degraded land and combat desertification. <br>
          
          In addition to the Waterboxx, Groasis also offers a range of other products and services related to sustainable agriculture and reforestation. These include the Groasis Capillary Concrete, which uses capillary action to deliver water to plants in urban areas, and the Groasis Ecological Irrigation, which uses a unique system of buried pipes to deliver water to crops withâ€¯minimalâ€¯waste. <br>
